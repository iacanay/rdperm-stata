{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
{opt rdperm} provides a procedure for testing the null hypothesis of continuity of the distribution of baseline covariates at the cutoff in 
the regression discontinuity design (RDD). It implements the permutation test procedure outlined in Canay and Kamat (2016).{p_end}


{title:Options}

{phang}
{opt c:utoff(#)} specifies the cutoff or threshold value in the RDD treatment rule. The default is c(0).

{phang}
{opt q:observations(#)} specifies the number of effective observations used from either side of the cutoff, which are those with running variable values closest to the cutoff. The rule of thumb option is set by q(0). The default is q(0).

{phang}
{opt p:ermutations(#)} specifies the number of random permutations performed to obtain the critical value. This must take a positive integer value. The default is p(999).

{phang}
{opt cvm} specifies whether the cvm test statistic is used in the joint test with multiple covariates. If this option is omitted then the max test statistic, as described in Canay and Kamat (2016), is used by default. Note that with a single 
covariate these two test statistics are identical.
